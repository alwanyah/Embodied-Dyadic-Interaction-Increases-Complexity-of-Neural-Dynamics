# Embodied Dyadic Interaction Increases Complexity of Neural Dynamics: A Minimal Agent-Based Simulation Model


#TODO 

-how to connect RNN output to webots
    -motor output 
        [float] between 0.0 and 1.0 for left and right weel, just going forward
    -sound output
        dont know

-connect webot output to RNN
    -2 microphone inputs
        [float] between 0.0 and 1.0 for left and right microphone, just intensity?


-how to have 3 outputs from 2 neurons

-define optimization function
    -neural activation?



# overall goal
-train 2 interactive agents that achieve similar entropy to ~0.8
-record both behaviours and train multiple agents on each ghost interactively
